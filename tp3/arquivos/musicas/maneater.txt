She'll only come out at night
The lean and hungry type
Nothing is new, I've seen her here before
Watching and waiting
Ooh, she's sittin' with you but her eyes are on the door

So many have paid to see
What you think you're gettin' for free
The woman is wild, a she-cat tamed by the purr of a jaguar
Money's the matter
If you're in it for love, you ain't gonna get too far

(Oh-oh, here she comes) watch out boy she'll chew you up
(Oh-oh, here she comes) she's a maneater
(Oh-oh, here she comes) watch out boy she'll chew you up
(Oh-oh, here she comes) she's a maneater

I wouldn't if I were you
I know what she can do
She's deadly man, she could really rip your world apart
Mind over matter
Ooh, the beauty is there but a beast is in the heart

(Oh-oh, here she comes) watch out boy she'll chew you up
(Oh-oh, here she comes) she's a maneater
(Oh-oh, here she comes) watch out boy she'll chew you up
(Oh-oh, here she comes) she's a maneater

Ooh
(Oh-oh, here she comes) here she comes, watch out boy she'll chew you up
(Whoa-oh, here she comes, watch out) she's a maneater
(Oh-oh, here she comes, she's a maneater) ooh, she'll chew you up
(Oh-oh, here she comes) here she comes, she's a maneater
(Oh-oh, here she comes. Watch out) she'll only come out at night, ooh
(Oh-oh, here she comes) here she comes, she's a maneater
(Oh-oh, here she comes, she's a maneater) the woman is wild, woo
(Oh-oh, here she comes) here she comes, watch out boy, watch outboy
(Oh-oh, here she comes) oh, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out
(Oh-oh, here she comes) yeah, yeah, she's a maneater
(Oh-oh, here she comes, she's a maneater) she's watching and waiting, ooh
(Oh-oh, here she comes) oh, she's a maneater
